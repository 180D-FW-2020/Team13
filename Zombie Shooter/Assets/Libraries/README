This folder contains all third-party libraries used to process input sources and networking.
In particular, the following folders contain libraries for the following functions:

Speech Recognition (library reference: https://github.com/Funnyguy77/PocketSphinxUnityDemo)
    PocketSphinx/
    SpeechRecognition/
    TarReader/

Computer Vision (OpenCV-Sharp) (library reference: https://github.com/shimat/opencvsharp)
    OpenCV/




Future Plans:
Ideally, these libraries will be pre-compiled to allow for faster build times and storage, as the 
raw source code for these libraries is unnecessary. In that case, these copiled DLL files would
be placed in the Plugins/ directory.
