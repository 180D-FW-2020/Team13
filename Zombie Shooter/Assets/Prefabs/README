This folder contains all game prefabs.

Prefabs are Unity GameObjects that has pre-defined characteristics (all scripts and variables)
have already been preset. These prefabs can be initialized during runtime and can be dynamically
placed and modified in the environment. The main dynamically instantiated game elements are the following:


Player.prefab
When a new player joins, this object is instantiated with given player properties, so that the
remote state can update the model/properties during gameplay

Zombie.prefab
The zombies (enemies) need to be instantiated for each level at the defined locations.

Score Card.prefab
When a new player joins, a new scorecard is instantiated in the UI to represent each player's 
score and health
